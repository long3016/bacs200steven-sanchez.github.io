    <p>I'm an instuctor at UNC, as well as a full time employee in the IT department.  My title in IT is <em>Business Analyst</em>. I consult with users across campus to help them utilize technology in their every day business processes.</p>
    <p>At home I am a husband, father of 4, and fixer of things.  I love researching and coming up with DIY projects around the house, especially when I get to put my technical expertise to use.</p>
